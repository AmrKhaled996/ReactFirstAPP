# ReactFirstAPP

## About the Project
This is my first fully self-made project using React! ðŸŽ‰ I built this project as part of a course I took to learn React, and it helped me apply fundamental concepts such as components, props, and state.

## Features
- **React Components**: The project is structured using reusable components.
- **Props and State**: Implements props for dynamic data and manages state effectively.
- **React Hooks**: Uses hooks like `useState` for state management.
- **Styled UI**: Aesthetic design with custom styling.

## Tech Stack
- **React (Vite)** (JSX, Components, State, Props, Hooks)
- **CSS** (for styling)
